## Visual & Interaction Design Principles

This document defines the **design philosophy, visual language, and interaction rules**
for the Attention Gym + Meaning Maps app.

It exists to:
- preserve a calm, restrained aesthetic over time
- prevent drift into “wellness”, “productivity”, or “self-improvement” tropes
- guide UI decisions without prescribing exact layouts

This is not a pixel-perfect design spec.
It is a **set of constraints and intentions**.

---

## 1. Design intent (first principles)

The app should feel like:
- a margin
- a pause
- a quiet instrument
- something that does not demand

It should *not* feel like:
- a coach
- a tracker
- a wellness brand
- a productivity tool
- a motivational system

The design should reduce pressure, not add it.

If a design choice increases urgency, excitement, or performance anxiety, it is wrong.

---

## 2. Overall aesthetic

**Tone:** calm, neutral, thoughtful  
**Energy:** low, steady, unforced  
**Character:** human, restrained, slightly serious  
**Mood:** clear rather than soothing

The app should feel trustworthy because it is:
- consistent
- quiet
- uninterested in impressing the user

---

## 3. Colour system

### 3.1 Core palette (recommended)

**Background**
- Warm off-white / parchment  
  - `#F6F4EF` or `#F5F3EE`
- Avoid pure white (feels clinical).

**Primary text**
- Near-black, warm  
  - `#1F1F1D` or `#22211F`

**Secondary text**
- Muted stone / graphite  
  - `#6B6A66`

**Accent (use sparingly)**
- Desaturated blue-grey or moss  
  - Blue-grey: `#5F6F7A`  
  - Moss: `#6A7B5C`

**Warning / emphasis**
- Soft rust (never bright red)  
  - `#9C5A3C`

### 3.2 Colour rules

- No bright primaries
- No gradients in MVP
- No colour-coded “good/bad” states
- Colour should never shout or reward

Colour is for legibility and gentle orientation only.

## 4. Typography

### 4.1 Font choices (recommended)

Primary font should be:
- readable
- neutral
- human

Good options:
- **Inter** (safe, neutral default)
- **IBM Plex Sans** (thoughtful, restrained)
- **Source Serif 4** (if a touch of gravity is desired)

### 4.2 Typography rules

- No playful fonts
- No ultra-thin weights
- Body text: 16–17pt equivalent
- Line height: generous (1.4–1.6)

Text should feel **considered**, not energetic.

---

## 5. Layout & spacing

### 5.1 General layout principles

- Fewer elements per screen than feels “normal”
- White space is functional, not decorative
- Content should breathe

### 5.2 Buttons & controls

- Buttons should look optional, not urgent
- Prefer text buttons over filled buttons where possible
- Avoid high-contrast CTA blocks

Examples:
- “Log a moment” → text button
- “Skip” → always visible
- Never hide exits or back actions

---

## 6. Motion & interaction

### 6.1 Motion rules

- Subtle fades > slides
- Short durations
- No bounce, spring, or celebratory motion

### 6.2 Timers

- Timers are containers, not countdowns
- Avoid ticking sounds or urgency cues
- The user should feel free to stop at any time

Interaction message:
> “You’re allowed to stop.”

---

## 7. Copy tone (design meets language)

### 7.1 Tone guidelines

- Observational, not motivational
- Declarative, not encouraging
- Neutral, not upbeat

Preferred language:
- “Today’s practice”
- “Log a moment”
- “This tends to show up”
- “Often appears with”

Avoid:
- “Great job”
- “Keep going”
- “You’re building a habit”
- “Well done”
- “Improve your…”

### 7.2 Emotional neutrality

The UI should never:
- praise
- scold
- reward
- shame
- imply success or failure

Completion is not achievement.
It is simply completion.

---

## 8. Screen-specific guidance (high level)

### 8.1 Home

- Sparse
- One clear focus: Today’s Practice
- Map access secondary
- No progress indicators

### 8.2 Practice

- Instruction centered
- Minimal chrome
- Timer unobtrusive
- Exit always available

### 8.3 Post-practice

- Acknowledge completion quietly
- Offer logging without pressure
- “Skip” equally weighted

### 8.4 Map

- Calm data presentation
- No charts that imply performance
- Language focuses on appearance, not evaluation

---

## 9. Branding restraint

This app does not need:
- a slogan
- an inspirational tagline
- a mascot
- decorative illustrations

Identity emerges from:
- restraint
- consistency
- quiet confidence

It should feel *considered*, not marketed.

---

## 10. Design drift warning signs

If you see:
- bright colours
- streak visuals
- celebratory animations
- “you’re doing well” copy
- progress bars tied to personal improvement

Stop.

Those changes violate the intent of the app.

---

## 11. Design success criteria

If the design is working, users should feel:
- slightly more spacious
- slightly less rushed
- not judged
- not pushed
- quietly invited, not instructed

Not happier.
Not calmer.
Not improved.

Just less filtered.
